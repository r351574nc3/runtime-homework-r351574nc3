## Welcome!

The goal of the homework assignment is to start the technical conversation
between you and the Runtime Team. We will be using this homework to first get a
sense of how you approach a problem and solve it by writing software.

Once we have had a chance to review your completed homework and we are mutually
interested in continuing the conversation, we will schedule time to pair program 
with you. More on the pairing sessions below.

## Homework Assignment

The emphasis of the homework assignment is seeing how you would approach
solving [a problem](problem.md). We tried to come up with a problem that you can
do in a couple hours, and we don't expect you to spend too much time on this.

Please write the solution in the language of your choice. Yes, any. Now the
[problem](problem.md) itself requires setting up the ability to take a web
request, so some languages, say `bash`, might be a bit trickier to use. But
again, we want you to have fun with this, be comfortable, and happy.

Lastly please provide instructions for running your homework in a `README.md` file.

Happy Hacking!

### Here are some tips from us to you

* Be comfortable and write code you can explain
* Simplicity is your friend
* Don't spend more then a couple hours on this unless you are having so much fun
* Use the language of your choice
* If you want a language recommendation, how about Go, Ruby, or Python?
* Show your progress via small `git commits`
* If you have time write tests
* Let us know if you have any feedback on any of this! We always are wanting to improve and your comments are important!
